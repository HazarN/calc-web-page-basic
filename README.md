# calc-web-page-basic
A simple calculator project written in basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript

One of my first projects in my front-end area. I used an implementation of a state machine that defined by my teacher CÃ¼neyt AKINLAR.

There are 2 themes for the calculator app(deafult theme is white). Themes' are divided into 2 css files and are controlled in one common css file. 
index.html file is static. and script.js file is used in implementation of the calculator functions.
